<h1>Data Type</h1>
<p>A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number</p>
<h3>There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript</h3>

<h2>Number </h2>
<p>for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.</p>
let n = 123;<br>
n = 12.345;
<P>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.<br>
There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.<br>
Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.<br>

alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity <br>
alert( "not a number" / 2 + 5 ); // NaN<br>

<h2>BigInt</h2>
<p>BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length..</p>
A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:<br>

// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt<br>
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

<h2>String</h2>
A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.<br>

let str = "Hello";<br>
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';<br>
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;<br>
In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.<br>

1.Double quotes: "Hello".<br>
2.Single quotes: 'Hello'.<br>
3.Backticks: `Hello`.<br>

<p>let name = "John";<br>
// embed a variable<br>
alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!<br>
// embed an expression<br>
alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3<br></p>

<h2>Boolean (logical type)</h2>
The boolean type has only two values: true and false.<br>
This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.<br>

<p>let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked<br>
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked<br></p>

let isGreater = 4 > 1;<br>
alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")<br>

<h2>The “null” value</h2>
The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.<br>
It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:<br>

<p>let age = null;</p>

<h2>The “undefined” value</h2>
The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.<br>
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.<br>
If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:<br>

<p>let age;<br>
alert(age); // shows "undefined"<br>
let age = 100;<br>
// change the value to undefined<br>
age = undefined;<br>
alert(age); // "undefined"<br></p>

<h2>Objects and Symbols</h2>
The object type is special.<br>
The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.<br>

<h2>The typeof operator</h2>
The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.<br>
It supports two forms of syntax:<br>
As an operator: typeof x.<br>
As a function: typeof(x).<br>

<p>typeof undefined // "undefined"<br>

typeof 0 // "number"<br>

typeof 10n // "bigint"<br>

typeof true // "boolean"<br>

typeof "foo" // "string"<br>

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"<br>

typeof Math // "object"  (1)<br>

typeof null // "object"  (2)<br>

typeof alert // "function"  (3)<br></p>
